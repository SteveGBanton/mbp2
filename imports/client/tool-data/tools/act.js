  description: 'To enhance discussion, allowing your team to share ideas more effectively and find solutions faster. This is especially effective for discussions about marketing and product development because it provides a structured system to inject multiple perspectives into a discussion that may otherwise be overlooked eg. To include a perspective about customer behaviour or a perspective about how society affects customer decisions.',
  beforeYouStart: 'This can be use in meetings or while working on a project to make sure everyone on the team is objective and brings strategic points of view to the discussion. Before the meeting/project starts, the manager or innovation lead should give each team member an actor card. That card represents a specific role, and each team member needs to play that role. This doesn\'t mean that they canâ€™t share their own opinion, it just means that they also need to think about ideas from the point of view of their new role.Roles may represent things, people or feelings.',
