Each team is a group of tourists traveling in the jungle with a tour guide. During their tour, they are captured by a tribe of cannibals. The cannibals have eaten the guide and locked up the tourists. Since the cannibals filled up on the guide, they have one week until they take their next victim. 

The tourists will need to choose who will be eaten next, and will need to choose who will be eaten each week afterward. When a character is eaten, he or she can no longer be part of the discussion, but can stay and listen. The interpreter needs to negotiate with the cannibals, so he or she always makes the decision of who will be eaten (with input from the team).
