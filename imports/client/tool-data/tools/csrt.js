Start the interview. Make sure you are filming or recording and your tell the participants the purpose of the research. 

When the Card Sort portion of the interview begins, give them the cards you have created, and ask them to arrange the cards or choose specific cards according to a specific factor you may be looking for. 

For example, you can ask them to arrange the cards by:
- what is most important to them
- what is harder for them
- which cards they like the most
- a timeline / storyline
- what cards they would choose based on a scenario

If you think there is a specific factor that would change the behaviour of your customers, ask them to rearrange the deck or choose other cards by changing a factor. For example, ask them how they would sort the cards if they had more money or if they were older, or if they had kids, etc.

When asking an interviewee about a timeline or story, make sure to provide blank cards so that the interviewee can add portions of the story that may be missing from your card deck. This may reveal critical behavior you have not anticipated.`,
