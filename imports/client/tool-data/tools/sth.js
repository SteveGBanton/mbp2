  description: 'Edward de Bonoâ€™s Six Thinking Hats is used to bring different perspectives to your thinking process in a systematic way. It is also a good exercise for a team in that it trains team members to use alternative ways of thinking more often. For example, those who tend to think about problems can learn to think about possibilities, and vice versa.',
  beforeYouStart: `
A hat is used to emphasize a certain way of thinking or to switch to a different style of thinking when you get stuck during a brainstorm session or meeting. Before and after using the hat the conversation is a traditional argument or discussion.

You can generally use the hats in one of two ways:

1. You can decide on a topic you want to think about from the outset and determine a sequence for using the hats, which will represent your thought process for the session.

2. Everyone on the team gets one hat and needs to focus on that style of thinking while they are wearing the hat. You can periodically exchange hats with different team members.

**Additional Tips**

* Allow limitless time for white hat discussions when a lot of information needs to be digested, but keep the thinking focused on the subject.
* Be flexible with green hat thinking. Switch to a different hat once the flow of ideas has stopped. You can always come back to the green hat later on.
* Restrict red hat thinking to 30 seconds to prevent people from wanting to explain or justify their feelings. Only allow more time when intuition and feelings are a major issue in the subject of study. For example, you may want to extend time for the red hat when discussing how a customer feels.
* The hats represent a style of thinking. They do not describe people, thinking habits or thoughts.
